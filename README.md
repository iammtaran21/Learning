Ridge (L2 Regularization):
Mathematical Expression:

Copy code
L2 = Loss + λ * Σ(w_j^2)
�
2
L2 is the Ridge regularization term.
Loss represents the original loss function without regularization.
�
λ is the regularization strength parameter.
Σ(w_j^2) is the sum of squared weights.
Interpretation:

Ridge regularization controls the size of the weights by penalizing large weights.
The term Σ(w_j^2) prevents any single weight from becoming too large, ensuring a more stable and generalized model.
Lasso (L1 Regularization):
Mathematical Expression:

Copy code
L1 = Loss + λ * Σ|w_j|
�
1
L1 is the Lasso regularization term.
Loss represents the original loss function without regularization.
�
λ is the regularization strength parameter.
Σ|w_j| is the sum of the absolute values of weights.
Interpretation:

Lasso regularization encourages sparsity in the model by driving some weights (w_j) to exactly zero.
The term Σ|w_j| acts as a feature selection mechanism, effectively ignoring less important features.
Summary:
Both Ridge and Lasso add a regularization term to the original loss function.
The regularization strength parameter (
�
λ) controls the impact of the regularization term.
Ridge prevents large weights by penalizing the sum of squared weights.
Lasso promotes sparsity by penalizing the sum of absolute values of weights.
